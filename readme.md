# PrestaShop Multishop Selector

## About
With this PrestaShop module, visitors can choose, from the home page, which store they want to visit.

## Contributing
PrestaShop modules are open-source extensions to the PrestaShop e-commerce solution. Everyone is welcome and even encouraged to contribute with their own improvements.

## Installation
- You must enable Multiple Shops : Enable multistore in Preferences > General (see [Documentation](http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS16/Managing+Multiple+Shops) for more information).
- You must have, at least, three stores.
- The Default shop is used only as the home page.
- Create a folder named multishopselector in modules. Copy all files in this folder.
- After activating this module, attach this module to displayHome and displayNav in Appearance > Positions only for the default shop.
- You must remove modules from displayHeader and displayHome to hide useless elements on the home page.
